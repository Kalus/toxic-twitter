realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 22:06:08,Just watched former Intelligence Official Phillip Mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful @PARISDENNARD over Brennan's Security Clearance. Dennard destroyed him but Mudd is in no mental condition to have such a Clearance. Should be REVOKED? @seanhannity
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 21:46:12,.@DianeHarkey is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment & potential. She is running as a very popular Republican for the Congressional seat of my friend Darrell Issa-with his complete support. Diane is strong on crime loves our Military & Vets-has my total Endorsement!

realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 13:14:59,It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China. We can and must END THIS NOW! The Senate should pass the STOP ACT - and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. No more delay!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 10:46:15,"""Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn't happen."" Darrell Issa House Oversight. We can take out the word ""apparently.""  @FoxNews"
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 10:36:23,"Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions  ""Justice"" Department? A total joke!"
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 10:23:57,"Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance it's worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn't because of the good job he did! He is a political ""hack."""
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 10:13:19,I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country's history brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won't sue!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 07:48:12,Where's the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 07:38:44,....looking for trouble. They are enjoying ruining people's lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies the firings the deleted Emails and soooo much more! Mueller's Angry Dems are looking to impact the election. They are a National Disgrace!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-20 07:28:45,Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency. Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone....
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-19 08:24:38,Study the late Joseph McCarthy because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby! Rigged Witch Hunt!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-19 08:14:44,Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times. They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-19 08:06:43,The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite - & the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-19 07:30:41,No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction. What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crooked's Emails!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-19 07:15:12,....and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller & his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-19 07:01:47,"The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel he must be a John Dean type ""RAT."" But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn't have to. I have nothing to hide......"
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-18 18:12:30,I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!
realDonaldTrump,2018-08-18 17:51:11,The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria. Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the U.S. I want to develop the U.S. our military and countries that help us!
